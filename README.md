# Mapping Earthquakes

### Overview
This week's challenge was a really fun project using new Leaflet skills along with JavaScript and API knowledge to create several different map layers and "overlays" that show information like the earthquakes in the past 7 days, the major earthquakes, and the tectonic plate lines around the globe.
